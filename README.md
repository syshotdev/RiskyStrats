# RiskyStrats
This is a complete remake of the game "Risky Strats" by White Collar Games from Roblox. https://www.roblox.com/games/316264464/RISKY-STRATS
This is made in Godot. I decided to make this project because I didn't like how I couldn't change any of the settings, and it was feasible.
I have beginner knowledge in Godot which is why the code is "not very good" , but I decided this would be small enough of a project with my skills.

Itch.io link coming soon when I iron out the bugs and make it playable.

What it looks like currently:![riskyStratsGithubPic](https://github.com/syshotdev/RiskyStrats/assets/152672515/d82b601d-965e-4b2e-b6ac-85a1a8af4595)

Some features I've yet to implement is proper building support, multiplayer, AI, UI, maps, settings menu, and turning around units.
No doubt there are bugs, but it's good enough.
